# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## 0. Print a list of integers
function that prints all integers of a list.
### Guidelines
Format: one integer per line.
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
## 1. Secure access to an element in a list
function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
### Guidelines
If idx is negative, the function should return None
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
## 2. Replace element
function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
### Guidelines
If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
## 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
### Guidelines
Format: one integer per line.
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
## 4. Replace in a copy
function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
### Guidelines
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
## 5. Can you C me now?
function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
### Guidelines
The function should return the new string 
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use str.replace()
## 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
function that prints a matrix of integers.
### Guidelines
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
## 7. Tuples addition
function that adds 2 tuples.
### Guidelines
Returns a tuple with 2 integers:
The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument
The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the two tuples will only contain integers
If a tuple is smaller than 2, use the value 0 for each missing integer
If a tuple is bigger than 2, use only the first 2 integers
## 8. More returns!
function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
### Guidelines
If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None
You are not allowed to import any module
## 9. Find the max
function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
### Guidelines
If the list is empty, return None
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use the builtin max()
## 10. Only by 2
function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
### Guidelines
Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
The new list should have the same size as the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
## 11. Delete at
function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
### Guidelines
If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change (returns the same list)
You are not allowed to use pop()
You are not allowed to import any module
## 12. Switch
Complete the given source code in order to switch value of a and b
### Guidelines
Your code should be inserted where the comment is (line 4)
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
## 13. Linked list palindrome
function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
### Guidelines
Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
An empty list is considered a palindrome
